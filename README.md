# ramen_scattering
a pet project where I try to optimize signal strength in a fiber optics cable with multiple channels

In fiber optic communication many channels can be present. However due to stimulated ramen scattering the signals present at each frequency experiences losses. In order to combat this a power source is introduced to the cables to strengthen signals and have all channels be at the same gain level at a desired distance. I am trying to optimize the power signals in this pet project.
